//Here is the link to the question
//https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/

//Problem statement:-
//Given an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer.
//You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.


//Easy approaach using cyclic sort.
//Approach:-
//We are gonna apply cycle sort, but we will ignore negative elements, 
//because positive element is asked in the question. 
//Also, we will ignore all those elements who values are greater than the size of the array. 
//In this way, the first element in the array which is not present in its correct position (index), will be the answer.

//Cycle Sort:-
//When we are given numbers from 1 to N (not necessarily exactly from 1 to N) we use cycle sort.
//It sorts the entire array in one single pass.
//The basic idea behind cycle sort is the sorted array will contain elements on their correct index.
//For eg. - elements from 1 to 5 will be on index 0 to 4 in the sorted array.
//Advantages are :- It sorts the array in-place and does not require additional memory for temporary variables.
